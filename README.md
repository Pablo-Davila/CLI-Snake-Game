# Snake Game
 The classic Snake game, developed in C++ and ran whithin the
 console. The program creates a "Score history" text file and updates
 it after every game.

I worked on this proyect many years ago, during Secondary
School. Therefore the code is quite chaotic, but it is (surprisingly)
perfectly playable.
